# In-house-algorithm-to-find-the-shortest-path-between-two-points-navigating-optimized-checkpoints.
This Python code was developed to find the shortest distance between two airports(randomised on an Euclidean plane using random points) navigating through the optimized waypoints(randomised on an Euclidean plane).
The In-House algorithm is developed based on the geometrical functions and linear algebra to find the optimised waypoints that fall under the main route. The code was developed to build a conceptual working OWSAS(On-board Weather Situation Awareness System) system.  This algorithm operates similarly to Dijkstra's and K* algorithms but does not rely on graph theory. Instead, it utilizes geometric functions and linear algebra to calculate the shortest path efficiently.  It is computationally much less expensive than Dijkstra's and K* algorithms, as it focuses on optimized points rather than evaluating all available routes, although it may require more precision.
Users are encouraged to fork this repository and further develop the code or utilize it for their own projects.
