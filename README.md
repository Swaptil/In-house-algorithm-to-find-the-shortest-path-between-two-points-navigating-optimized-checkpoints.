# In-house-algorithm-to-find-the-shortest-path-between-two-points-navigating-optimized-checkpoints.
This Python code was developed to find the shortest distance between two airports(randomised on an Euclidean plane using random points) navigating through the optimized waypoints(randomised on an Euclidean plane).
